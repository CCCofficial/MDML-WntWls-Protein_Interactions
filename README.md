# <center>Characterizing Wnt-WLS Interactions</center>
***  

## Objective 
This project aims to provide a deeper understanding of Wnt ligand binding behavior by examining interactions between WLS and other important molecular entities.

As part of two summer internships [Kevin Cheng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-jose-cheng1), a PhD student from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), working in the [Center for Cellular Construction (CCC)](https://centerforcellularconstruction.org/) with [Sara Capponi](https://research.ibm.com/people/sara-capponi), modeled and ran several molecular dynamic simulations (additional detail and code provided in `<repository placeholder>`). [Tiffany Callahan](https://research.ibm.com/people/tiffany-callahan) extends this work by leveraging machine learning to identify, examine, and characterize similarities and differences between the examined Wnts.

This repository provides tools for interacting with and processing molecular structures and data from molecular dynamic simulations. It will also include code and workflows for building and training a variety of robust machine learning models.
